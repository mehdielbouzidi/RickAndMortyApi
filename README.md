# RickAndMortyApi
The following project is my solution to the Rick and Morty developers case (https://github.com/graciousagency/rick-and-morty-case).
I tried to make the most out of it with the limited time due to an illness. For displaying and filtering the data I used search bars, I misread a given episode with a given name somehow. Other then that, location and origin can be searched upon and I added in an extra API while working with React Hooks. The code is really ugly unfortunately (for now).

This case however inspired me to continue improving and building something like: https://pokedex.org/
